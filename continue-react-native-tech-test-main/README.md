# Continue Tech Test

## Introduction

Welcome to the Continue tech test. This repository is a Next.js boilerplate application designed for you to showcase your skills. Your task will be to create a products list page and a product detail page (PDP).

## Task

1. **Products List Page:**
   - Create a page that displays a list of products using the provided array of products.
   - Each product should be displayed with basic information such as name, price, and image.
   - Ensure that the design is clean and user-friendly.
   - **BONUS TASK**: Implement search and/or filtering capability.

2. **Product Detail Page (PDP):**
   - When a product is clicked on the products list page, navigate to a detailed page for that product.
   - The PDP should display detailed information about the product including a larger image, description, price, and any other relevant details.
   - Pay attention to the design and user experience.
   - **BONUS TASK**: Implement a "Favourite" feature allowing users to mark a product as a favorite and persist the favorite status across page reloads.

## Guidelines

- **Use of Chat GPT:**
  - Using Chat GPT or any other AI tools is allowed.
  - Absolutely NO COPY PASTING from these tools. You should thoroughly understand and be able to explain every line of code you write.
  
- **Design and Style:**
  - Emphasis on design and style is crucial. We want to see your ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
  - You should use Tailwind CSS for styling, but feel free to use any UI libraries you like.

- **Simplicity:**
  - Don't overthink the task. We are looking to see how you perform with a straightforward assignment.
  - Focus on delivering a clean, functional, and well-designed application.
